# 2. Use Python 3.6.x as a main version.

Date: 2021-07-24

## Status

Accepted

## Context

AWS introduced a new version of services that supports many Python versions, resulting in the adoption witch performance upgrades, some breaking changes. The least common denominator - is version 3.6.x.

## Decision

I have already been using Python 3.6.x as a base version in the repository.

## Consequences

For me, there are none for now, as I am using `python3` anyway.
