# 3. Using Serverless Framework.

Date: 2021-07-24

## Status

Accepted

## Context

I want to use Serverless Framework [serverless](https://www.serverless.com). Its Infrastructure as Code mechanics is a practical approach to all topics related to this *Pet Project* configuration and operation. Everyone should get familiar with [getting-started](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/getting-started/).

## Decision

This framework will speed up writing the whole automation.

## Consequences

Little vendor lock-in because of cloud provider-specific configuration parameters. The YAML standard is more imperative than declarative, but it gets the job done.
